# WEEIA-JAM

## Jam's topic :arrow_right: 'A hacker hacked your brain', explanation:
<br />
#### You are playing in the headquarters of a big corporation. Your goal is to beat all of the levels - 
#### - walk through each floor. The last floor is occupied by the Hacker. He is stealing all of the data, 
#### stored on the last segment of the building. To beat a level you need to solve logic puzzles - 
#### move crates in such a way that would allow you to pass through tight spaces in the skyscraper...
#### Additionally each level is harder to beat - the closer you are to the Hacker the more access he has to your brain.
#### Each of the Hacker's 'Brain Damages' (hacks) freezes your character for 1 second... On top of that, sometimes you
#### begin to hallucinate and hear weird voices that make it harder to focus. Odd, eerie sounds, voices can be heard.
#### Scary text appears on players screen along with the whispers... Good luck.
